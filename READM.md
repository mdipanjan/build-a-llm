- This is a follow along of the book written by **[Sebastian Raschka](https://github.com/rasbt)**

- This repository contains the code for developing, pretraining, and finetuning a GPT-like LLM and is the official code repository for the book **[Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](https://amzn.to/4fqvn0D)**
- I'll add the code corresponding to each chapter as I progress.
